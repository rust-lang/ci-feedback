# ci-feedback

As discussed in [zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/242791-t-infra/topic/All.20Hands.3A.20CI.20requirements/near/505480772), we use this repository to collect feedback on how to improve rust-lang/rust CI.

We use [discussions](https://github.com/rust-lang/ci-feedback/discussions) because they support threads (GitHub issues don't).
Feel free to reply to existing discussions or create new ones if you want to discuss about something that isn't covered
by any of the existing discussions.
